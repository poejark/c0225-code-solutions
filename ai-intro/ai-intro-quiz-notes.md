## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- Will AI replace software developers?
  AI is certainly transforming the software development landscape, but it's unlikely to fully replace software developers in the near future. Right now, AI is being used to automate repetitive tasks (like bug fixing, writing boilerplate code, or even suggesting solutions) and improve productivity. But software development is a deeply creative and problem-solving process, and that's something that still requires human expertise.

AI tools can assist developers, but humans will still be necessary for the higher-level design, architecture, and understanding of complex systems. Developers also bring intuition, creativity, and a deep understanding of users’ needs, which AI lacks. So while AI will be a powerful assistant, it will probably not replace developers—at least not anytime soon.

- What is the best way to use AI tools when learning software development?
  AI can be a fantastic ally when you’re learning software development. Here are a few ways you can use it effectively:

Code Assistance: Tools like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and others can help you understand and write code faster by suggesting completions, offering solutions to problems, or explaining concepts you’re stuck on. They can save time but shouldn’t be relied on exclusively.

Debugging and Code Review: AI can help you identify errors, suggest optimizations, and even help you improve the readability of your code. This can be especially helpful when you're still getting the hang of debugging.

Learning Resources: AI can help you find explanations and resources when you're stuck. You can ask for explanations in simpler terms or get references to documentation and tutorials for further study.

Practice and Exercises: Some AI tools can generate coding challenges or projects that you can use to practice your skills.

- What is the danger of using AI tools for software development while I'm still learning?
  There are a few potential risks if you rely too much on AI tools during your learning process:

Lack of Understanding: If you let AI generate code for you and don’t try to understand the logic behind it, you could miss out on learning important concepts. It’s easy to get into a “copy-paste” habit, which doesn’t help you build your foundational knowledge.

Over-reliance on AI: Relying on AI to solve problems without attempting to figure things out on your own can hinder your critical thinking and problem-solving skills. The ability to debug, refactor, and optimize code is something you learn through experience, and AI cannot replace that learning process.

False Confidence: AI tools are powerful, but they’re not perfect. They can suggest inefficient or incorrect solutions, especially if the context isn’t fully understood. If you don't critically evaluate the output, you might start building bad habits or using suboptimal solutions without realizing it.
