  A function is an object (in javscript) that may accept arguments and perform actions and results.

  declaration, arguments, and body.

  funcName(val)
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  a definition defines the properties and behavior of a function, while a function call is the invocation of a function based on its definition.
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  A parameter is a template or archetype, while an argument is a specific value that conforms to this template.
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  They allow us to work with variables with unique values within a function.

  it ends the execution of a function and provides a result in the place where the function was invoked.
- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?
  var varName = (arg) => "return"
