## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
  a point where conditional css is evaluated.
- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
  The ratio is maintained across different width and heigh screen dimensions, making design more consistent over variable interfaces.
- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller width after the styles for a larger width in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the smaller width will "win". Why is that?
  It was evaluated later, and also evaluates to true if the larger condition before it was also true. Due to the format of css, it updates the page.
