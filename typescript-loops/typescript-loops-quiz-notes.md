  Before the execution of each pass of the loop.
- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  At the end of the pass of each loop.
- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
