Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the `event.target`?
  the element that fires the event.
- What is the effect of setting an element to `display: none`?
  hides it on the page.
- What does the `element.matches()` method take as an argument and what does it return?
  It takes a string and returns a boolean value whether or not the element contains that selector.
- How can you retrieve the value of an element's attribute?
  getAttribute()
- At what steps of the solution would it be helpful to log things to the console?
  within the for loops to perceive node values being pickked up.
- If you were to add another tab and view to your HTML, but you didn't use event delegation, how would your TypeScript code be written instead?
  it would have its own even listener.
- If you didn't use a loop to conditionally show or hide the views in the page, how would your TypeScript code be written instead?
  Maybe I'd have to make 3 separate web pages with minor differences.
